## Markdown Magic Unleashed

Welcome to the Markdown Extravaganza! Brace yourself for a journey through the syntax wonderland where backticks, asterisks, and brackets dance in harmonious prose.

### Text Styling with Backticks

1. **Bold Magic:** Wrap words in double backticks for **`bold`** emphasis.
2. *Italic Whispers:* Single backticks for *`italic`* enchantment.
3. **Code Sorcery:** Triple backticks create a code block:

```javascript
const magicSpell = "Markdown Extravaganza!";
console.log(magicSpell);
```
